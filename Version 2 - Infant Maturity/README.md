Emma's notes! (Updated 07.15.21)

*****************************
***Virtual Baby Version 2***
*****************************

This version is a follow-up to the original Virtual Baby (VB) paradigm. This version is to test the effect of immature sensory cues from the infant in driving parental behavior. Specifically, we want to compare mature to immature babbling (and potentially silence versus ambient babbling), as well as mature to immature locomotion (crawling vs. walking). We should expect effects of sensory cue maturity and parental status. 

Notably, version 2 will also include a number of optimization updates and bug fixes.

notes I thought to include when it comes to making changes within the game files.
