Emma's notes! (Updated 07.15.21)

*****************************
***Electrophysiological Setup**
*****************************

In the original Virtual Baby (VB) paradigm, it was not clear if participants were physiologically experiencing arousal or stress. Given the importance of arousal for directing attention, it is important to know whether the paradigm is valid in inducing stress in parents. 

To measure arousal (as a proxy for stress), we have decided to record Galvanic Skin Conductance (GSC) while exposing parents to the original stimuli. GSC can be used in tandem with the original paradigm or updated versions. 

I will do my best to also include hardware build notes within this directory.
